🎥 IG Downloader  

📌 About  
This script is part of StampSynk, a personal project where I share useful and efficient tools for various tasks.  
The IG Downloader allows you to easily download multiple Instagram video links on Windows, using a simple and intuitive interface.  

All scripts available here are 100% created by me and will continue to be improved over time.  

🚀 Features  
✔ Download multiple Instagram videos in the best available quality  
✔ Simple and easy-to-use GUI  
✔ Automatic merging of video and audio  
✔ No need for a web browser—just paste the link and download  

⚙️ Requirements  
To ensure proper video and audio merging, FFmpeg is required. Please install it using one of the following methods:  

🔧 Install FFmpeg on Windows  
✅ Method 1: Install via Winget (Recommended)  
Simply open Command Prompt (cmd) or PowerShell and run:  
winget install "FFmpeg (Essentials Build)"  

✅ Method 2: Manual Installation  
Download FFmpeg from the official website: ffmpeg.org.  
Extract the downloaded files and move them to a permanent location, e.g., C:\ffmpeg.  
Add FFmpeg to the system's PATH and verify the installation using:  

ffmpeg -version  

If the version information appears, FFmpeg is installed correctly! ✅  

🔧 Installation & Usage  
1️⃣ Download the script from stampsynk.com  
2️⃣ Install Python (if not already installed)  
3️⃣ Install yt-dlp (required for downloading videos)
